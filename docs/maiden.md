## Characters

### Capitol Lord

He only  talks to the maiden if she has a specific reputation score or greater (value?). Nobody refers him by his real name.

### Guild Master Ketil (caldeir√£o)

He is passionate about exploration, but rarely travels now due to the road perils. From time to time, might need help to go from a place to another.

### Big Bad Boss Vidar

From the realms above, the winter is usualy a nice time for viking. So Vidar travels south for booting and destruction. Not really a bad character, but might look ruthless due to need and to prevent any heroic person from taking a stupid action like confronting him.
